	abstract = {Of 102 alcoholics admitted to an alcoholism treatment unit one third (33) were clinically rated as having a disabling agoraphobia and/or social phobia, and a further third (37) as having less disabling phobic symptoms of either or both kinds. Questionnaires and self-report symptom scales were used to validate the clinical ratings. Alcohol problem screening tests and consumtpion levels confirmed the severity of alcohol dependence. In a group of 44 phobic alcoholics who reports and physical dependence significantly more frequently than the converse. The prevalence of agoraphobia and social phobia in alcoholics is discussed in relation to prevalence date in affective and normal populations, together with their implications for the aetiology of phobias and alcohol det approaches and prognosis.},

	abstract = {Twenty-four hospitalised problem drinkers who were currently suffering from a phobic anxiety state served as subjects for this study. Each was given a detailed retrospective interview concerned with the development over time of both their alcohol dependence and phobic problems. The test-retest and inter-rater reliabilities of the data collected were found to be high. In accordance with previous experimental work, periods of heavy drinking and dependence upon alcohol were associated with an exacerbation of agoraphobia and social phobias. Subsequent periods of abstinence were associated with substantial improvements in these phobic anxiety states. It is suggested that both learning and psychobiological processes underly these observed relationships and that the implications of this finding for treatment of both disorders should be explored.},

	abstract = {Studies on alcoholic patients have found a higher than expected prevalence of panic disorder, and suggest a positive correlation between the level of alcohol consumption and severity of anxiety. Conversely, there is an increased prevalence of alcoholism among patients with panic disorder and their blood relatives. A comparison of symptoms, physiological and neurochemical changes known to occur in both alcohol withdrawal and panic disorder reveals a degree of similarity between the 2 conditions. Based on the data, we propose that the chemical and cognitive changes occurring as the result of repeated alcohol withdrawals may kindle and condition coincidence of panic attacks in susceptible individuals. Implications of our postulates for treatment of alcohol withdrawal and panic disorder in alcoholics and for future studies are discussed.},

	abstract = {Outpatient agoraphobics with panic were studied to determine the nature and extent of their alcohol use/abuse and its relationship to phobic symptoms. From 10 to 20\% were alcoholic by {DSM}-{III} diagnoses, self-labeling and screening with the Michigan Alcohol Screening Test. Comparisons on self-report measures of demographically similar groups of alcoholic agoraphobics (n = 22) and non-alocholic agoraphobics (n = 21) revealed differences on a variety of etiological and current clinical dimensions. The identified alcoholics were more depressed, more socially phobic, more fearful of somatic symptoms when nervous or afraid and more likely to engage in catastrophic thinking. They also rated recent panic attacks as more intense, and reported smaller reductions in phobic avoidance when accompanied by a trusted companion. Use of alcohol to self-medicate for dysphoria was reported by 91\% of the alcoholics and 43\% of the nonalcoholics. Substantial proportions of the alcoholics used alcohol to reduce anxiety, to control disturbing cognitions, to accomplish necessary activities, including work or school requirements, to venture into public, and to cope with the anticipation of panic attacks. Implications for research and treatment are discussed.},

Over half the sample met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ({DSM}-{III}) criteria for agoraphobia (8.5\%), social phobia (7.8\%), and avoidant personality disorder (35.1\%). More than 70\% of the Ss in each diagnostic category were men. For the majority of Ss, the disorder preceded the abuse of alcohol, which was used by at least 40\% of them to relieve their distress in the past. For many Ss, alcohol still had a moderating effect on distress at the present but appeared to be mainly used out of psychological dependence. (French abstract)},
